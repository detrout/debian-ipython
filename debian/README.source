IPython/frontend/html/notebook/static/ contains minified javascript sources
for jquery and prettify
the unminified sources are available in IPython/external
The package does not use the minified version or do any minifiaction during the build
instead uses packaged versions where available and just overwrites the minified version
with the unminified from external during the build.
